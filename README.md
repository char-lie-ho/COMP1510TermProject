#### Game overview
Welcome to the CST Student Adventure at BCIT! In this text-based game, 
you'll step into the shoes of a Computer Systems Technology (CST) student navigating the challenges of BCIT. 
Your ultimate goal is to reach Term 4, ace an interview, and secure a job.

As you walk on the map, you will encounter Leetcode questions ,and you will have to solve them. 
Successfully answering a question will reward you with valuable knowledge, essential for advancing to higher terms.

To reach the interview, gather enough knowledge and head to the bottom right corner of the map. 
Your success in the interview may lead to a job offer. However, be mindful of your stress level. 
If it surpasses 50, your character will pass out, bringing the game to an end. 
Need a break? Visit home to reduce stress.
